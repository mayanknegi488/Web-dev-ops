               Hey! I'm <strong>Mayank Negi</strong>. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about typing. Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. And I learned it all using my <strong>will power</strong>, so i built my self-esteem and stayed motivated. Join me in this rewarding journey. You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
